# End-to-end MLOps for Time Series

This project aims at covering the whole Machine Learning lifecycle by incorporating MLOps best practices. You will find scripts for data ingestion, preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, model training and deployment.

The code you will find in this repo can easily be transfered to any Machine Learning project involving Time Series or, more generaly, tabular data.

## Tech stack

- Python 3.10.11
- Pandas for data manipulation
- AWS as Cloud provider
- The Scikit-Learn API for Machine Learning estimator interface
- Optuna for Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)
- MLFlow for model and data tracking
- Flask for model deployment
